Swift
=====
Dynamic optimisation mod for Minecraft 1.16.1 (Forge)

What does it do?
----------------
Swift is an attempt at combining some of the best existing community optimisation techniques - whether it's from an old abandoned mod or from a different modding platform entirely (e.g. Fabric) - while also making sure that compatibility is maintained with other mods such as Optifine's shaderpack feature.

In addition to this, I've provided some of my own optimisations and features to the table for Swift, such as seeing the average and 1% lows in the F3 debug menu and dynamically switching graphics settings on the fly to maintain more consistent performance in a heavily computationally-variable game.

What's included?
----------------
- A complete port other jellysquid3's excellent Lithium and Phosphor 1.16 mods for Fabric to Forge
    - While jellysquid3 does offer Lithium and Phosphor for 1.15 Forge, they are very stripped down and outdated compared to their Fabric counterparts and there is no sign of them being updated for 1.16 Forge.
- Portions of jellysquid3's Sodium 1.16 Fabric mod are being ported and then tested in isolation for compatibility and those that play nice with other mods are kept.
